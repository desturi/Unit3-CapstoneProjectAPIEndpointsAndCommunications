/*
 * LESSON NOTE: Booking Pricing Request DTO - Booking Service to Pricing Service Communication
 *
 * This DTO represents the data that the BOOKING SERVICE sends TO the PRICING SERVICE
 * when it needs to calculate the total cost of an booking.
 *
 * Data Flow: Booking Service â†’ Pricing Service (via REST API)
 *
 * Key Differences from BookingRequest:
 * - BookingRequest: What CLIENTS send to us (external API)
 * - BookingPricingRequest: What WE send to other services (internal API)
 *
 * Why separate DTOs?
 * - Different services may need different data formats
 * - Internal APIs can change without affecting external clients
 * - Security: We control what data gets sent between services
 * - The pricing service might need additional fields in the future
